*python-pptx* is a Python library for creating and updating PowerPoint (.pptx)
files.

This is a fork of scanny's original project. Its sole purpose is to allow me 
to develop functionality for reading and writing slide notes. At some point
I'll have enough time to fix this up all nice and make it pretty enough for
scanny to accept a pull request, but damned if I know when that will be.
